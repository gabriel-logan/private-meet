# Private Meet

A private chat, video, and voice meeting application built with Nestjs, Handlebars, WebRTC, and WebSockets(Socket.io).
Free, open-source, and self-hostable.

## Purpose

Private Meet is designed to provide a secure and frictionless way to connect with others without the need for accounts or metadata collection. It emphasizes end-to-end confidentiality, structured access control, and transparent technology that users can fully trust.

## Public Demo

You can try out a live demo of Private Meet at [https://private-meet-76by.onrender.com](https://private-meet-76by.onrender.com).
This demo is hosted on Render.com and may have limitations on usage.
We are not using TURN servers, so connectivity may vary based on your network conditions.
We are using free instances, so performance may vary.

## Features

- No accounts required — create or join a room instantly.
- Flexible room identifiers — define IDs with 1 to 128 characters, or generate unguessable ones via UUID v4.
- End-to-end encrypted chat for private messaging.
- WebRTC-based voice, video, and screen sharing, with low latency and peer-to-peer security.
- Unlimited participants in each room.
- Structured access control to manage entry and participation.
- Open source freedom — anyone can clone, self-host, and redeploy Private Meet on their own infrastructure.
