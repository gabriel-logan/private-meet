## Presentation

Most communication apps today require accounts, collect metadata, or limit user control. Whether you are an individual, a small group, or a large community, there is a clear need for a **secure and frictionless way to connect**.

The goal was to design a platform that anyone can use — without registration — while ensuring **end-to-end confidentiality, structured access control, and transparent technology** that users can fully trust.

That’s why we built **Private Meet**, a real-time communication platform powered by **NestJS, Handlebars, Socket.io, and WebRTC**. With Private Meet you get:

* **No accounts required** — create or join a room instantly.
* **Flexible room identifiers** — define IDs with **1 to 128 characters**, or generate unguessable ones via **UUID v4**.
* **End-to-end encrypted chat** for private messaging.
* **WebRTC-based voice, video, and screen sharing**, with low latency and peer-to-peer security.
* **Unlimited participants** in each room.
* **Structured access control** to manage entry and participation.
* **Open source freedom** — anyone can clone, self-host, and redeploy Private Meet on their own infrastructure.

**Private Meet** makes private communication available to everyone. It is **simple, secure, and transparent by design** — giving users complete control over how and where they connect, whether it’s one-on-one, in a group, or at scale.
